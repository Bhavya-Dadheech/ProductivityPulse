# Task-Manager
This is a basic task management application.
I have created this project with angular for frontend and springboot(java) for backend , for the sole purpose of learning how to create rest API's in springboot.
I also learned how to authenticate/authorize users with jwt tokens and AuthGuard using localstorage for client side.
This application performs all the basic crud operations along with authentication and authorization of registered users.
