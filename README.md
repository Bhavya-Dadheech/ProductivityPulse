# ProductivityPulse

This comprehensive task management application is the result of a hands-on learning journey that combines Angular for the frontend and Spring Boot (Java) for the backend. Developed with a primary focus on mastering the creation of RESTful APIs in Spring Boot, this project offers a robust platform for managing tasks efficiently.
The application covers fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, providing users with a seamless experience to organize and oversee their tasks. Notably, the project delves into the intricacies of user authentication and authorization using JWT tokens. By implementing an AuthGuard mechanism and leveraging local storage on the client side, the application ensures secure access for registered users.

Key features include:
  
  1.CRUD Operations: Perform essential task management actions with ease, allowing users to create, view, update, and delete tasks effortlessly.
  
  2.Authentication and Authorization: Employing JWT tokens, the application authenticates and authorizes registered users, ensuring secure access to their personalized task management environment.
  
  3.Angular and Spring Boot Integration: The frontend, built with Angular, seamlessly interacts with the backend powered by Spring Boot. This integration results in a responsive and dynamic user interface.
  
  4.Learning Focus: The project serves as a valuable educational tool, providing practical insights into REST API development, user authentication, and authorization techniques.
