# Task-Manager
This is a simple Task Management Application.
I have created this project in with angular and springboot , for the sole purpose of learning how to create rest API's in springboot.
I also learned how to authenticate/authorize users with jwt tokens form the backend and AuthGuard for the frontend.
This application performs all the basic crud operations and also authentication and authorization functionality.
